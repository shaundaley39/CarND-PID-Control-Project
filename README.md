Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

# Objectives

"PID controllers" - some readers will have flashbacks to their first year of engineering school, with mathematical models, phase diagrams and stability calculations.
That's not what we'll be doing here.
This project will put implement a simple PID controller in code, and put PID controllers to use, managing a car's throttle and steering input to maintain the car at a target speed and on a target trajectory as it drives around a race circuit.

## P, I and D

- a short description of the proportional, integral and differential components in a PID controller
- 3 two-column tables, each showing a well-tuned car on the left, and on the right the same controller but with the P, I or D coefficient increased by perhaps 10-20%.

## Hyperparameter Optimization

- short discussion of "twiddle"
- the importance of the metric/ penalty
- the results (for at least one case)

## Results

  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.
